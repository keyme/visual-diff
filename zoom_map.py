            #   - If none of the 4 pixels is set, we should not be set.
            #   - If 1 of the 4 pixels is set, we're set a quarter of the time.
            #   - If 2 of the 4 pixels are set, we're set half the time.
            #   - It's impossible to have 3 of the 4 pixels set.
            #   - If all 4 pixels are set, this one should be set, too.
            # To discuss the times when half the pixels are set:
            #   - If the two that are set are on the main diagonal, we should be
            #     set. It's good to make diagonals easy to see.
            #   - If the two that are set are off the main diagonal, we should
            #     not be set.
            #   - If the two that are set are adjacent to each other, we should
            #     be set half the time.
            # To discuss times when 1 pixel is set:
            #   - If the 1 pixel is off the diagonal, it might be part of a
            #     large diagonal line shifted 1 pixel off of our diagonal. Half
            #     of these should be set.
            #   - If the 1 pixel is on the diagonal, we should not be set (so
            #     that we're set a quarter of the time overall).
            # To satisfy all these conditions, we should be set either if both
            # pixels on the diagonal are set or if 1 pixel off the diagonal is
            # set.
